# Stat231P2

In order to run our code, please visit http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ and download the 5-core data for each of the categories there.  Then, put it in a folder called "Project Data" inside the main Stat231P2 directory.  For the sake of saving you time, our code only uses the following categories, so if you don't want to work with the largest files, you can just use the:

Amazon Instant Video, Automotive, Digital Music, Musical Instruments, Office Products, Patio Lawn and Garden, Pet Supplies, Tools and Home Improvement.


Only run Project2.Rmd
